I spent 8 years working in low-voltage electrical panel design, building strong technical foundations, precision, and problem-solving skills. Driven by a growing passion for technology and digital products, I made a deliberate career shift into front-end development and interactive web design.

I’m currently at the early stage of my front-end journey, actively learning and building. I have earned 11 certifications and continue to sharpen my skills through hands-on projects. I believe in continuous growth, clean code, and creating meaningful user experiences. This transition marks a new chapter in my career — and I’m fully committed to mastering it.
